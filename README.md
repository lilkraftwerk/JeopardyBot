Twitter bot. Not affiliated with Jeopardy or the honorable Alex Trebek. Find it [here](https://twitter.com/trebek3000).

Started by scraping thousands of Jeopardy clues from a fan-run site, then formatting them and posting them to Twitter once every couple of hours. Uses wkhtmltoimage to get the clues looking like they're actually on Jeopardy.

Now, let's play.... Jeopardy!
